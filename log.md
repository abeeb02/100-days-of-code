### Day 1: December 18th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I built a *very* rough first draft of Harry Potter sorting application, using the Harry Potter API, Javascript, HTML, & CSS. 

**Thoughts**
This one hour of code flew by. Ultimately I am proud that I have something that produces a result, but I would like to add more complexity and functionaly.
