# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 18th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I built a *very* rough first draft of Harry Potter sorting application, using the Harry Potter API, Javascript, HTML, & CSS. 

**Thoughts**
This one hour of code flew by. Ultimately I am proud that I have something that produces a result, but I would like to add more complexity and functionaly.

### Day 2: December 19th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I was limited by the speed of my internet - but we perservere!

**Thoughts**
Did not get as much done as I would have liked. My programming consisted of troubleshooting some SQL issues (sorry can't post that one). Then finally got to improving, what I know hope will be the start of a full blown Harry Potter application. But now there are photos! *ooooohhh* because GUI matters.
